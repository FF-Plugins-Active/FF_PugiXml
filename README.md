# NOTE
* We don't use Rider. So, we can't help about IDE specific problems.
* If your problem is about "PugiXml's itself", you need to open your issue in there. Not here.
* If your problem is about "our implementation", you can open an issue about it.
* We don't support older engine versions and we update engine version after "one month of its release".
* Our plugin doesn't have any dependency or tricky setup. If you don't know how can you install a plugin to UE5, we can't help you.
* If you see weird "variable is not valid" like problems and variables have underlines, it means you couldn't install plugin, correctly.
* Look at plugin's "Content" folder before using it. It has a "BP_Template_PugiXml" actor and it contais sample mechanics.
* You "can" use this plugin in your commercial products but you "CAN NOT share this plugin" in marketplaces such as Gumroad or Unreal Marketplace/Fab. Please look at "License" section.
